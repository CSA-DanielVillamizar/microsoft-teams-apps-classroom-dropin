## Classroom Drop-in App Template

As learning has moved online, system leaders have a hard time monitoring what’s going on in the virtual classroom. They need a way to drop-in and observe how teachers and students are doing.
Also, there is a need to provide temporary access to substitute teachers.
  
In **Classroom Drop-in**, system leaders can find classrooms and add themselves to it with a specified drop-in period. This will add them to corresponding team or class.
They can also assign others (substitute teachers, evaluators etc.) to a class for a short period, as needed.

While the app comes with several innovative features, we hope it is easy for you to extend, enhance and adapt it for your needs since this is built using our low-code Power Platform. The app has several configuration settings that can be leveraged to customize the solution without any code changes.

Here are a few key features:
- Admin/Teacher/User can create drop-In with the help of "New drop-in" tab and extend/delete drop-ins with the help of "My active drop-in" tab.
- Classroom Drop-in app provides ability to search schools and teams or classes to drop in.
- For every drop-in, app sends notification to admin as well dropped-in user.
- Admin or System Leader can drop-in self or someone else.
- After specified time of drop-in, the access will get revoked from assigned user and the user will get notification for the same.
